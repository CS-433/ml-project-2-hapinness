# 2nd Team Project for EPFL ML course CS-433
## Team name: **haPINNess**
## Team members

Thibaud Martin: thibaud.martin@epfl.ch

Arthur Lamour: arthur.lamour@epfl.ch

Justin Manson: justin.manson@epfl.ch

## Goal
Discover and implement **Physics Informed Neural Networks** (PINN) on various differential equations:
- Cauchy Problem: 1D inference, importance of randomization, extrapolation performance test
- Viscous Burgers' equation: 2D inference and identification
- Heat equation: 2D inferences on different freqencies, 3D inference

Inference: find the solution of a differential equation with initial and/or boundary condtions.
Identification: knowing the solution, identify the parameters of the differential equation the solution solves.
